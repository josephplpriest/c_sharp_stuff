# Dice rolling console app

This is a short C# console app that simulates rolling a d6 until the user inputs a key. 

It then prints the number of rolls and the average of those rolls.

```
You've rolled a 6
You've rolled a 4
You've rolled a 5
You've rolled a 5
You've rolled a 6
You've rolled a 2
You've rolled a 4
You've rolled a 6
You've rolled a 6
You've rolled a 1
The average of your 10 rolls was: 4.5
```

#### Note: There is an unhandled exception if the user inputs a key before the first loop iteration ;-)
